# What is Distri?

Distri is a server-client software package that brings distributed, or [<span style="color: blue">volunteer computing</span>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volunteer_computing) to the browser. (Faster math for your project!) [<span style="color: blue">Distri-Node</span>](https://github.com/Flarp/Distri-Node) is the server, powered by Node.js, that distributes the work to the clients. The client, [<span style="color: blue">Distri.js</span>](https://github.com/Flarp/Distri-JS), runs in your browser, and accepts work from a Distri server.

Inspired by [<span style="color: blue">BOINC</span>](http://boinc.berkeley.edu/), this bundle aims to allow the computing power of the volunteer pool to be greater than ever with it coming to the web.

# Okay, but what about consent?

Distri asks for consent to use the user's computer for science on first time visiting the page, so the user is not blindly used for what the website owner wants them to be used for.

# Alright, I want to start building servers!

Great! Visit the documentation for [<span style="color: blue">Distri-Node</span>](/doc/node) and [<span style="color: blue">Distri.js</span>](/doc/js) to get started.
